The canteen provides a rewarding opportunity for parents to be involved in their child's school.Students do not need to leave the school for their lunches, which allows more time for eating and means that parents do not need to rush to pack a lunch in the morning. Improving a student's overall nutritional health is another benefit.</p>

      <p class="list-group-items-text col-lg-7-col-md-7-col-sm-7-col-xs-7">Researchers have found a strong correlation between attendance for school and academic performance and success. Children that miss school frequently often fall behind— both academically as well as professionally. Absence from school is often the biggest single cause of poor performance and achievement.When students are not frequently absent, their grades and reading skills often improve—even among those students who are struggling in school. Students who frequently attend school feel more connected to their community and develop strong social skills and friendships, which are important life skills. </p>
